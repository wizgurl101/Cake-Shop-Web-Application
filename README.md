## Description
This is a web application that allow users to create an account with a fictional bakery, Delightful Sweets. User can then place an order for baked goods to be deliver on a particular date.  The "fake" bakery can use the admin account to manage their clients and see a list of baked goods needed to be made for the current day.

## About the project
This project was based the one built in Brad Traversy's MERN sCommerce Udemy course that I took.  This is meant for me to apply and practice what I learnt to make a full-stack web application using the following technologies:
- Node.js
- Express
- React + Redux
- MongoDB

## Application Features
- User can create an account to place order
- Admin can manage users, products and orders
- Integration of PayPal to handle payment transaction

## What have I learnt from this project
- Development of a RESTful E-commerce web application using MERN stack
- Implementation of Redux to manage application-wide states
- Application of JSON web token for authorization purpose
- Using React-Bootstrap library to rapidly build UI
- Using Postman for API testing
- Using MongoDB Compass
